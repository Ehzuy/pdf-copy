# pdf-copy

main.py lets you enter a pdf file name(must be in same directory) and ouput the content to a txt file without changing the format of the original text.
clipboard.py does the same but instead of creating a result.txt, it directly copies the output into your clipboard so that you can ctrl+v immediately into any editor of desire
